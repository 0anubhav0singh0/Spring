	- Provides a platform and protocol independent framework to build mail and messaging applications
	- Optional package for reading, composing and sending email
	- The protocols that support the Java Mail API are :-
		- (SMTP) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  		- Provides a mechanism deliver email 
		- (POP)  Post Office Protocol 					- provides access via an Internet Protocol (IP) network for a user client application to a mailbox ( maildrop) maintained on a mail server.

		- (MIME) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension	- Defines the content of what is being transfered 
		- (NNTP) Network NEWS Transfer Protocol			- Protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news server, and for reading/posting articles by the end user client application
	- Java application uses Java Mail API to compose and receive email's, the SMTP, IMAP and POP transfers the message packages from the server side to the client side
	- Classes of Java Mail API
		- javax.mail.Session
		- javax.mail.Message
		- javax.mail.Address
		- javax.mail.Authenticator 
		- javax.mail.Transport
		- javax.mail.Store
		- javax.mail.Folder
		- javax.mail.Internet.MimeMessage
		- javax.mail..Internet.Address
	- Steps followed in sending an email are 
		- 1. Getting a session
		- 2. Creating a default mimemessage object 
		- 3. Set from,to and subject in the message
		- 4. Set the actual message as Message.setText
		- 5. Send the message using the transport object	
	- While checking an email open the respective folder and only check the header of each message i.e. from, to and subject
	- Fetching an email along with the header also read the content by recognizing the content type
	


Features of Properties class:
	- Properties is a subclass of Hashtable.
	- It is used to maintain a list of values in which the key is a string and the value is also a string i.e; it can be used to store and retrieve string type data from the properties file.
	- Properties class can specify other properties list as itâ€™s the default. If a particular key property is not present in the original Properties list, the default properties will be searched.
	- Properties object does not require external synchronization and Multiple threads can share a single Properties object.
	- Also, it can be used to retrieve the properties of the system.
